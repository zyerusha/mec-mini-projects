For this project, you will use the Databricks Platform and work through a series of exercises using Spark SQL. The dataset size may not be too big but the intent here is to familiarize yourself with the Spark SQL interface which scales easily to huge datasets, without you having to worry about changing your SQL queries. \n\nThe data you need is present in the mini-project folder in the form of three CSV files. This data will be imported in Databricks to create the following tables under the __`country_club`__ database.\n\n<br>\n1. The __`bookings`__ table,\n2. The __`facilities`__ table, and\n3. The __`members`__ table.\n\nYou will be uploading these datasets shortly into the Databricks platform to understand how to create a database within minutes! Once the database and the tables are populated, you will be focusing on the mini-project questions.\n\nIn the mini project, you'll be asked a series of questions. You can solve them using the databricks platform, but for the final deliverable,\nplease download this notebook as an IPython notebook (__`File -> Export -> IPython Notebook`__) and upload it to your GitHub."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Creating the Database\n\nWe will first create our database in which we will be creating our three tables of interest"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%sql \ndrop database if exists country_club cascade;\ncreate database country_club;\nshow databases;"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Creating the Tables\n\nIn this section, we will be creating the three tables of interest and populate them with the data from the CSV files already available to you. \nTo get started, first upload the three CSV files to the DBFS as depicted in the following figure\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QcCruBr.png)\n\n\nOnce you have done this, please remember to execute the following code to build the dataframes which will be saved as tables in our database"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# File location and type\nfile_location_bookings = \"/FileStore/tables/Bookings.csv\"\nfile_location_facilities = \"/FileStore/tables/Facilities.csv\"\nfile_location_members = \"/FileStore/tables/Members.csv\"\n\nfile_type = \"csv\"\n\n# CSV options\ninfer_schema = \"true\"\nfirst_row_is_header = \"true\"\ndelimiter = \",\"\n\n# The applied options are for CSV files.
